To resume the installation of Ubuntu 24.04 from where it stopped, you'll need to follow a few steps to either continue the installation directly (if possible) or restart the process with minimal disruption. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you resume the installation:

### 1. **Reboot the System**
   - **Restart the computer** and boot from the installation USB drive or disk again. If the system crashed or rebooted due to overheating, it might attempt to continue the installation or at least provide an option to repair or resume it.
   
### 2. **Check for Resume Options**
   - **If the installer has a Resume option:**
     - After rebooting, you might see the **Ubuntu installer screen** again. Sometimes, the installer will automatically recognize that the system was previously interrupted and offer to **resume the installation** from where it left off.
     - If you see this option, choose **Resume** or **Continue Installation**.

### 3. **Select "Try Ubuntu" Mode**
   - If there isn’t an option to resume automatically, you can try selecting **"Try Ubuntu"** from the boot menu instead of directly proceeding with the installation.
     - This will allow you to boot into a live session of Ubuntu where you can check the state of the installation and possibly finish it manually.
   
   - **After booting into "Try Ubuntu" mode:**
     - Open a terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and try mounting the partition where Ubuntu was being installed.
     - You may need to mount the target disk to check if it’s partially installed or to proceed with the remaining installation steps manually.

### 4. **Manually Resume Installation (if necessary)**
   If you can't resume directly, and you're in the "Try Ubuntu" mode, follow these steps to manually resume the installation:

   - **Mount the root partition of the installation:**
     First, identify where Ubuntu was being installed using the `lsblk` or `fdisk` command:
     ```bash
     lsblk
     ```
     This will list all the partitions. Identify the partition where Ubuntu was being installed (usually it will be the largest partition).
     
     For example, if it’s `/dev/sda1`, mount it:
     ```bash
     sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
     ```

   - **Chroot into the system:**
     After mounting the partition, you’ll need to "chroot" (change root) into the system to interact with it like it’s running. This allows you to continue the installation or fix any issues:
     ```bash
     sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
     sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
     sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys
     sudo chroot /mnt
     ```

   - **Check the status of the installation:**
     Now, you are inside the system’s environment and can check the status of the installation. You might want to check for any missing packages or issues in the logs.

     You can use the following commands to check for installation logs:
     ```bash
     cat /var/log/installer/syslog
     cat /var/log/installer/partman
     ```

   - **Finish the installation manually:**
     - If the installation stopped during package unpacking or due to missing dependencies, you can try fixing it by running:
       ```bash
       sudo apt update
       sudo apt upgrade
       sudo dpkg --configure -a
       sudo apt install -f
       ```

### 5. **Reinstall or Repair the Boot Loader**
   If the system doesn't boot after the installation process is completed (but is partially installed), you might need to **reinstall the bootloader** (GRUB).

   - To reinstall GRUB, run the following commands inside the chroot:
     ```bash
     sudo grub-install /dev/sda
     sudo update-grub
     ```

   - This will ensure that the bootloader is correctly set up to boot the installed system.

### 6. **Reboot and Check the Installation**
   Once you’ve finished the steps above, exit the chroot environment:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```
   Then unmount the partitions and reboot the system:
   ```bash
   sudo umount /mnt/dev /mnt/proc /mnt/sys /mnt
   sudo reboot
   ```

   After the reboot, your system should either continue the installation or boot into the newly installed Ubuntu.

### Additional Tips:
- **If you can't resume the installation or it’s not clear how to proceed**, consider **restarting the installation** from scratch. Since it is possible that some parts of the installation were corrupted or left incomplete, a fresh install may be the simplest way forward.
- If your system consistently shuts down during installation, consider **fixing the overheating issue** first (as described earlier) and then try the installation again.

These steps should help you either resume the installation or manually complete it from where it left off.
